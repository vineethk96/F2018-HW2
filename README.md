# F2018-HW2
P1) Implement the dynamic programming algorithm to solve the minimum cost path planning problem on a given graph

P2) Implement  and  compare  the  performance  of  Dijkstra  and  Aâˆ— algorithms  to  solve  for  the  minimum  cost
paths  on  a  given  graph.   We  will  consider  only  2D  grid  graphs  in  this  assignment.   The  edge  costs  are
the  distances  between  the  two  vertices.   Each  vertex  can  be  connected  to  at  most  eight  of  its  neighbors
(N,NW,W,SW,S,SE,E,NE).
